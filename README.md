# conductor
Routing layer for learner portal MFEs

## Why does this repo exist?  It's empty!

Conductor is an application that lives entirely in `edx/configuration` as ansible
plays.  However, GoCD requires an application to have a repo to track as a material

## So..

Yeah.  If we've deleted GoCD before we've deleted conductor, you can kill this repo

## This seems like a hack!

Yep.
